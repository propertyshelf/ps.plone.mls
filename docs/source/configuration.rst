Base MLS Configuration
======================

Before you can start embedding listings into your Plone site you have to connect to the MLS.
But don't worry, this only needs to be done once.
Please ask your MLS Administrator for your API Key.

To change the settings for your MLS embedding go to the **Site Setup** and select the Add-On configuration **Propertyshelf Base Settings**.
In the form, enter your MLS connection settings.
